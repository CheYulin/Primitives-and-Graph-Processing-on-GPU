###Primitives
- [Nccl](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)    
  - all-reduce, all-gather, reduce-scatter, reduce, broadcast  
- [Cub](https://github.com/NVlabs/cub)   
  - CUB provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA programming model
- [ModernGPU](https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu)
  - moderngpu is a productivity library for general-purpose computing on GPUs. It is a header-only C++ library written for CUDA. The unique value of the library is in its accelerated primitives for solving irregularly parallel problems.

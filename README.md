###Primitives-Cuda
- [Nccl](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)    
  - all-reduce, all-gather, reduce-scatter, reduce, broadcast  
- [Cub](https://github.com/NVlabs/cub)   
  - CUB provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA programming model
- [ModernGPU](https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu)
  - moderngpu is a productivity library for general-purpose computing on GPUs. It is a header-only C++ library written for CUDA. The unique value of the library is in its accelerated primitives for solving irregularly parallel problems.

###Primitives-OpenCL

###Utilities
- [VexCL](https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl)
  - VexCL is a vector expression template library for OpenCL/CUDA. It has been created for ease of GPGPU development with C++. VexCL strives to reduce amount of boilerplate code needed to develop GPGPU applications, supporting vector arithmetic, reduction, sparse matrix-vectork products, etc.
- [EasyOpenCL](https://github.com/Gladdy/EasyOpenCL)
  - Focus on programming the GPU instead of messing about with long C-style OpenCL function calls and manual memory management. CMake support for Linux and Mac - No more linking problems when you have installed the correct driver.
- [Hpx](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx)
  - A general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale http://stellar-group.org/libraries/hpx .
